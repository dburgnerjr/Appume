# Appume
Appume repository

The purpose of the Appume project is to reimagine a resume into a mobile app.  An appume is a new twist to a document
used to help a candidate find a job.  An appume provides links to a candidate's LinkedIn profile and GitHub 
repository as well as recommendations (testimonials) from former co-workers and associates speaking to the 
candidate's skills and experience.  One can directly email or call the candidate from the appume so that they could 
network with the candidate and tell the candidate about job leads they may have.
